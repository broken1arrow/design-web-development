         Välkommen till en dåligt designad hemsida, gjord med picso och markdown. Samt testar nytt sätt att skapa en grid med 12 rutor som jag använder namn i stället för manuelt sätta varje kolumns placering. 
      </p>
      <p>
         I testing also two p tag so I can see it works fine. This is just some extra text to show if this will break up the text correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
         More text to test so everything is working as it should. And yes I using HTML tags to better customize the page. As I don't know how this could be done inside just with markdown in a manageable way. 
      </p>
      <p>
         As I also need to learn other things and spend time to make git work (not an issue if you using Github Desktop, but it did not like the orginal path, as it colide with the school Github page) and also the page is broken on the school server. See if that could be fixed to sunday.  
      </p>
      <p>
          Change the body to a grid pattern, to allow more control over the flow. It also created some negative effects I needed to solve when using mobile. As the hamburger was baked in to the site-header and dropdown using other logic.
